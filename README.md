Built this site using HTML, CSS, js , jquery, and json. We had to create a day planner that saved and retained data in local storage after refresh.

### Visuals

This site shows a day planner. You can edit each time slot with text and hit save and it will store using local storage. You can leave the page and come back and your information will stay. You can overwrite the data as well.
